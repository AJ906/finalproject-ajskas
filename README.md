## What is this?
Music Friend Finder is an app for music artists and enthusiasts to meet each other through their shared interests in music. Users will input their musical preferences and meet other users with similar preferences by building playlists, rating others' playlists, rating artists and songs, and chatting with other users.  Users will also be able to give their preference to meet at live concerts and/or events, so they can schedule meetups with other users.
